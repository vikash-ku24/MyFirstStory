# MyFirstStory
This repository includes my first work towards making a story from a sample data

Here, I'm using a sample data collected from IBM Content section named "Great Outdoor Sales"
I use prepare data modules to line up the data for Extraction and other processes so that I can use this further to create Dashboards, Reports and Stories within IBM Cognos Analytics 11.0.0

Here in this story I process some intresting facts to find what makes the performance low and finds some intresting results which helps me to understand the critical numbers of the depatments and then try to provide some suggestions to improve the performance. This suggestions may lead the firm to match thier planned revenue.

This is a PDF file which is not dynamic so if you're intrested in their insights and want to perform some filter and other functions, you can examine my whole story here:- https://ap2.ca.analytics.ibm.com/bi/?perspective=story&pathRef=.my_folders%2FMy%2BFirst%2BStory%2B-%2BRevenue%2BPerformance&action=view&sceneId=model000001825475820f_00000000&sceneTime=17350
